# JagexLauncherBypass

JagexLauncherBypass is a collection of files designed to simplify the process of switching between different third-party clients, including Runelite and Devious.

## Usage
To start plese Download the devious client from [here](https://github.com/jbx5/devious-launcher/releases/download/devious-client-launcher-1.0.1/devious-client-launcher.jar)
### Windows  

To switch to the Devious client, follow these steps:

1. Download the `client-switcher.cmd` file.
2. Execute the `client-switcher.cmd` file. It will switch to and from the Devious client each time it is executed.

### Linux
1. Ensure you are using this [jagex launcher for linux](https://github.com/TormStorm/jagex-launcher-linux)
2. Download the `client-switcher.sh` file.
3. Execute the `client-switcher.sh` file. It will switch to and from the Devious client each time it is executed.

## Compatibility

These cmd files are currently compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems. We're actively working on creating scripts for Mac OS as well.

## Supported Clients

Our cmd files currently support switching between Runelite and Devious clients. We're committed to expanding support for additional free third-party clients as they become available. Additionally, we have a multi-client switcher in development to support even more clients.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try the following steps:

1. Navigate to the folder located at `%localappdata%/runelite`.

2. Verify that you have the correct JAR files in this folder. Ensure that the switching process is correctly modifying the filenames as expected.

3. To test the switching functionality, run `runelite.exe`. If the switching doesn't seem to work, follow these steps:

   a. Delete all JAR files in the folder.
   
   b. Download the backup Runelite JAR from RuneLite's GitHub [here](https://github.com/runelite/launcher/releases/download/2.6.8/RuneLite.jar).

   c. Re-download the switching script and run it again.
